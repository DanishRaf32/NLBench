# NonLinear Benchmark Models (NLBench)
## Collection of Large Scale Models for Testing Nonlinear Model Order Reduction Techniques
This repository provides a collection of sixteen large-scale benchmark nonlinear state-space models. The models are written in MATLAB and scalable in spatiotemporal degrees of freedom. The aim is to provide the active research community with a suite of high-dimensional nonlinear models to test the state-of-the-art nonlinear model reduction strategies.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the entire directory
2. Add the path to the working MATLAB directory
3. Run any experiment

All models are tested on MATLAB 2021a running on Macbook Air M1

Note: For the power system models you need MATPOWER 7.1 libraries installed [https://matpower.org](https://matpower.org)
